Handy scripts most of which were made by yours truly!

# Scripts
* arp-scan_to_ip.sh - This script will take the text output arp-scan and will strip out all the unique IPv4 addresses

* mount-shared-folders.sh - Will mount a shared folder in a Debian or Kali VM
* overlay.py - This Python script will compare two source trees and identify their differences and even will copy files from one source tree to the other
* strip_Invoke-Mimikatz.sh - This script will modify the Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 so it won't get flagged by Windows Defender
